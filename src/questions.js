    title: "Can houseplants help the quality of air in my house?",
    description:
      "Yes. The air inside your home might be filled with toxins from tobacco smoke, cleaning products, ceiling tiles, and upholstery. Scientists have discovered that many types of houseplants absorb airborne pollutants as part of their normal “breathing” process—they take carbon dioxide in through their leaves and let oxygen out.",

    title: "Why are rainforests so important to the health of our planet?",
    description:
      "In 1800 there were 7.1 billion acres of rainforest in the world. As of the first decade of the 21st century, less than half, or an an estimated 3.5 billion acres, remained. Thousands and thousands of acres of the world’s rainforests are destroyed each day, with trees cut down for their wood and land cleared for farming. While covering just two percent of Earth’s surface, the dense vegetation of these forests plays an important role in the health of our planet. ",

    title: "Why do people plant marram grass on sand dunes?",
    description:
      "Marram grass is a tough perennial grass that is often planted in shifting sand dunes to help stabilize them. Between the edge of the water and the beginning of the dunes, dry sand is constantly shifting and floating. One of the few plants that can take root in this windy environment is marram grass, which is also called beach grass. It spreads its tuberous roots just under the surface of the sand, and forms an underground web that helps hold the sand in place. This allows the soil to stabilize and the dune to grow higher.",

    title: "Which tree was used in the early American shipbuilding industry?",
    description:
      "During colonial times, the U.S. Navy used the oak tree’s hard wood to build its ships. The USS Constitution received its nickname, “Old Ironsides,” during the War of 1812 because its hull, made of live oak and white oak, was so tough that British warships’ cannonballs literally bounced off it. Because the Constitution was built before shipbuilders learned to bend or steam wood into shape, the long, arching oak branches were used as braces to connect the ship’s hull to its deck floors. ",

    title: "Which plant is used to make linen?",
    description:
      "Linen, one of the oldest human fabrics, is woven from fibers of the flax plant. The fibers are located in the stalk, which is picked by hand. After the fibers have been separated from the stalk and processed, they are spun into yarns and woven or knit into linen textiles. However, many years ago linen was used for sheets and is still used for household items such as tablecloths and personal items such as handkerchiefs. Slacks, dresses, suits, and blazers are all common clothing items made from linen today.",

    title: "How is cotton harvested?",
    description:
      "In places where cotton is not picked by hand, machines called pickers or strippers harvest the crops. Cotton-picking machines have spindles that pick (twist) the seed cotton from the burrs that are attached to plants’ stems. Doffers—a series of circular rubber pads—then remove the seed cotton from the spindles and knock the seed cotton into a conveying system. Conventional cotton stripping machines use rollers equipped with alternating bats and brushes to knock the fluffy white bolls, which contain seeds and hairs, from the plants into a conveyor. ",

    title: "What is paper made of?",
    description:
      "Around the world, people have made paper from a wide variety of plant materials, such as wood pulp, rice, water plants, bamboo, cotton, and linen clothing. The ancient Egyptians made paper from papyrus reeds that grew abundantly along the Nile River. Today’s paper fiber comes mainly from two sources: pulpwood logs and recycled paper products. In fact, much of the paper today is a blend of new and recycled fiber. To make paper commercially, companies mash up these wood fibers and mix them with water. ",

    title: "Are marine plants used in toothpaste?",
    description:
      "Yes, and lots of other products, too. Substances from marine plants and animals are used in many home products, including ice cream, toothpaste, fertilizers, gasoline, and cosmetics. If you read the labels of some of these products, you may find the words carrageenan and alginate. Carrageenans are compounds extracted from red algae that are used to stabilize and gel foods. Brown algae contain alginates that make foods thicker and creamier and add to shelf life. They are used to prevent ice crystals from forming in ice cream, for example. Alginates and carrageenans are often used in puddings, milkshakes, and ice cream. The remains of diatoms (algae with hard shells) are used to make pet litter, cosmetics, and pool filters. The kelp plant is often used in lipstick, toothpaste, and clothing dye.",
